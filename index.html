     <p>
        Food is a basic necessity for survival and also the key to a healthy life. Without regular healthy meals children struggle to go to school, carers struggle to work and communities are left battling to survive.

        <p>
            Emergency shelters or transitional shelters are a common issue in the aftermath of disasters. Worldwide, millions of houses are damaged or destroyed by disasters every year. People are forced to leave their homes and seek refuge, sometimes for short time and sometimes for a protracted period based on the nature of the disaster and the extent of the damage done to the housing structures.

        <p>
            Floods, which in recent years have taken the world by surprise, come into the discussion too. While that is the case, its impact on education systems is least discussed, if ever, yet literature acknowledges floods as one of the most devastating disasters ever recorded in human history globally.
